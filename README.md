This is my game - Tetris. 

The first thing you want to do is establish settings through program arguments. You can change the speed, width and height, and even the difficulty level. Make sure to enter you name for a chance at the top of the leaderboard!

Tap Right to go right and Left arrow to go left. Remember to rotate your piece with the help of Up and Down arrows. Try to line up pieces of the same color together!

The game ends when your pieces overflow.
