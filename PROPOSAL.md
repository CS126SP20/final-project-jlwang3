# **Tetris**

#####Author: Jeffrey Wang

I will be creating a game very similar to tetris. It will be a 10x10 grid of squares. If you leave the top of the field it is game over. 
Pieces will range from areas of 3-7.

Some libraries I may use potentially include: 
* Cinder-leapMotion
, which will help with the deceleration and acceleration of blocks once in the air. 
* Drawing inspiration from Snake, I will also using Color, Shape, and Time Libraries frequently. 

I will also aim to include a leaderboard through Queries. Additionally, I may add additional features such as if three blocks of the same color touch, then the blocks dissapear. Another idea may be to give bonus points based on the speed with which the user completes his rounds. Different game modes such as Survival, Speed Run, or Creative Mode.
